Replicates the custom column feature of the Manage Posts page for the Manage
Pages page.

== Description ==

Replicates the custom column feature of the manage posts page.  This is in response to the long-standing [enhancement request](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2284).  It provides a `manage_pages_custom_column` action and `manage_pages_columns` filter which can be used similarly to the `manage_posts_custom_column` action and `manage_posts_columns` filter provided by WordPress.

A tutorial on [how to add custom columns to the manage posts screen](http://scompt.com/archives/2007/10/20/adding-custom-columns-to-the-wordpress-manage-posts-screen) can be viewed on my website.

== Installation ==

Copy the `managepages` directory to your plugins directory and activate the Manage Pages Custom Columns plugin from WordPress.  You'll then have access to the `manage_pages_custom_column` action and `manage_pages_columns` filter.

Alternatively, you can copy the `managepages.php` and `JSON.php` files to your own plugin and distribute them.  To use, just include `managepages.php` using something like `require_once('managepages.php')` and continue as detailed above.  Don't worry about other plugins including the code also, you're protected.
